blobs start round by going to closest food to them, if they arrive and still have enough space around them that’s unpopulated, they eat, if 2 blobs arrive in same space, they will fight or one will flee.

OLD NEWS: turn based rounds, all blobs choose to stay, move, eat, or attack at each turn. can only eat if away from other blobs. order of operators: blobs move, then those that haven’t moved attempt their operation such as eat or attack.

OLD NEWS: Start with 20 by 20 grid, place 25 foods and 20 blobs randomly, 12 hours in day. food randomly replaced at morning, blobs don’t move overnight.
start with 25 Energy, max energy 100
eat food = +25 Energy
wait 1 hour = -1 Energy
travel 1 space = -3 Energy
sleep through night = -3 Energy
if Energy = 0 -> Dead
start fight = -1 Energy per attack
get fought = -2 Energy per attack
if one fighter dies then other wins and gets food
Health = rate * Energy + baseHealth
Aggression = -rate2 * Energy + 100
baseHealth = 50

At no food:
If Health > baseHealth * 3 -> Stay
Else -> Move toward nearest food based on aggression
If Health < Aggression -> nearest food
If Health > Aggression -> nearest food without blob there

At Food and Encounter:
If Health < Aggression -> Attack
If Health > Aggression -> Flee toward next nearest food
If Health == Aggression -> 50/50 chance
if one attacks but other flees, only attacker loses damage enemy

At Food but no Encounter:
first If nearestNeighbor < or = 3 spaces (manhattan distance) then wait 1 hour
else eat
if couldn’t eat, at next hour if nearestNeighbor < or = 2 spaces, then wait 1 hour
else eat
if couldn’t eat, at next hour if nearestNeighbor = 1 space, then wait 1 hour
else eat
else either there should be an encounter, end of night, or blob can eat at next hour even if nearestNeighbor = 1 because nearestNeighbor must not be moving.

OLD NEWS: once a blob starts moving toward a food, keep it moving toward same food by assigning it as targetFood and at new day all targetFood should be initially calculated as closest newly placed food based on aggression as determined above

create 3 3D plots of survival % after 5, 10, 25 days with rate and rate2 both in range 0-1 intervals of .1

for testing purposes, run one hour per button press.
for data run simulation for given conditions and produce the 3 survival % datapoints for plot, if possible run all 100 condition settings multiple times and average survival %s

export data as a csv file if able to do 100 simulations at a time


machine learning

allcreatures have different neural nets passed on during reproduction
track aggressiveness levels over time

inputs -> directions to nearest source of food and enemies and distances to walls
outputs -> appliedForceX and appliedForceY

or if not machine learning then see how values affect outcome

think about energy constant energy loss even if not moving

should starting and max energy be constant among all or dependent on size
